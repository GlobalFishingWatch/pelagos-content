<h2>
  Indonesia VMS Layer Added
</h2>
<p>
Indonesia partnered with Global Fishing Watch to become the first nation to publicly release its Vessel Monitoring System data (VMS). This layer was first made available in a dedicated public workspace in June 2017, and we are now releasing it as a primary layer in our free, public map of global fishing activity. You will see a new Activity Layer “NAME OF LAYER”. The layer is turned on by default and the Indonesian VMS data is displayed on the map in GREEN.

Learn more about about the <a target="_blank" href="http://globalfishingwatch.org/Indonesia-VMS/">Indonesian VMS</a> and how our <a target="_blank" href="http://globalfishingwatch.org/2017/11/vms-transparency.html">VMS initiative</a> is changing the global conversation around transparency in commercial fishing.
