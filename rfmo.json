    "description": "RFMO stands for Regional Fishery Management Organization. These organizations are international organizations formed by countries with a shared interest in managing or conserving an areaâ€™s fish stock. Some RFMOs manage all the fish stocks found in a specific area, while others focus on particular highly migratory species, notably tuna, throughout vast geographical areas. The RFMO Layer on the Global Fishing Watch map currently includes the five tuna RFMOs."
