    "description": "Blue sharks are marine predators distributed worldwide in temperate and tropical waters. Globally, blue sharks are commonly caught in large quantities in industrial longline fisheries as incidental bycatch yet their population status is not thoroughly known. In effort to illuminate the overlap between blue sharks (Prionace glauca) and fishing activity in near-real time, Dr. Austin Gallagher from Beneath the Waves tagged and released 10 blue sharks in the north Atlantic with satellite transmitters and integrated those data into Global Fishing Watch. After quality control and assessment of raw position information, this layer shows the original satellite transmitter position information as white dots; successive white dots are connected together in blue lines. The blue lines are the minimum straight-line distance between successive white dots and do not represent exact blue shark movements. The positions of the blue sharks in this layer are best approximates of where the sharks were when at liberty. The satellite transmitters used in this study were SPOT-6 (Specific Position or Tempertature) devices that communicate with ARGOS satellites. The transmitters use bursts of uplinks to generate locations when the antennae has breached the sea surface. In order to generate an ARGOS location of known accuracy, 3 or more uplinks must be received by one satellite in a narrow window of time ( < 15 minutes). More information on the accuracy of SPOT-6 tags can be read here <http://www.argos-system.org/support-and-help/faq-localisation-argos/. In this study, SPOT-6 transmitters were fin mounted on blue sharks that were caught using handlines and circle hooks to minimize capture stress. Once onboard, sharks were gently placed in a tagging cradle and a pump was placed into the sharks mouth to aerate the gills. All sharks were measured, tagged with conventional plastic tags, a SPOT-6 transmitter, and blood and muscle samples were taken before they were released. Once you add this layer to Global Fishing Watch, you will be able to visualize the approximate movements of these sharks while the SPOT-6 transmitters were transmitting.",
